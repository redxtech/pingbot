## join server & invite pingbot
i have an official pingbot instance and discord server. you are welcome to invite it to
your own server, and join the discord to discuss & get help with contributinig to
and hosting pingbot.

[**invite pingbot**](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=889104837243985932&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands)

[**join discord**](https://discord.gg/sMTjxfkaBq)

## features

### chance-based
for each message that is sent, there is (configurable) chance that pingbot will:
 - ping @everyone (the original feature, how it got it's name)
 - react with a random emoji (often eerily in-tune to the mood of the message)
 - set your nickname to a string of random characters (most fun when on a server where users can't change their own
     nicknames)
 - send you a random insult through dms
 - replying with an ascii chad face or rock look
 - one more secret bonus feature that i'm never gonna give up any hints about (spoilers in `src/things.ts`)

### match based
some other features are triggered by the content of the message
 - **pingbot love:** if you send a message that shows appreciation for pingbot (if it matches this regex:
		`/(\b((i|we)\b.+\b(love|like|appreciate))|(thanks))\b.+\bping\s*bot\b/`), pingbot will respond with
		a heart to show its appreciation of you.
 - **pingbot hate:** if you send a message that shows dislike for pingbot (if it matches this regex:
 		`/(\bi\b.+\b(hate|dislike)\b.+\bping\s*bot\b)|(\bfuck\b.+\bping\s*bot\b)|(\bping\s*bot (suck|eat|munche)s (dick|cock)\b)/`),
		pingbot will respond with a sad face that will randomly switch between forwards and backwards.
 - **o o f:** if you send a message that contains the word 'o o f' (any whitespace, including none),
 		pingbot will do one of two things: 1) if you are in a voice channel, pingbot will join your voice
		channel, play the roblox *oof* sound, and leave. 2) if you are not in a voice channel, pingbot
		will simply reply 'o o f' instead.
 - **oo oo aa aa:** there is also a monkey sound that is played for 'oo oo aa aa'
 - **birthday:** if you send a message that contains the word birthday, pingbot will react with
 		the first emoji on the server with birthday in its name
 - **no u:** pingbot will do the ol' uno reverse if you call him gay

### dms
if you send a dm to pingbot, he will respond by choosing from an array of replies, including
telling you to get out of his dms, he has a girlfriend already, and that's not what your mom
said last night

### god words & god passage
if you send the message `!pingbot words` or `!pingbot passage`, it will generate a ten random words and bible
passage respectively, a tribute to templeOS

## invite
to get an invite link for the current instance of the bot, run `/pingbot invite` and it will give you an
invite link

## configuration
if you are a server owner, you (and anyone else with `MANAGER_SERVER` permissions) can use the `/pingbot <name> <value>`
to set the probabilities of each chance-based feature (autocompleted). additionally, you can view the current probabilities
and reset them to default with `/pingbot-probabilities` & `/pingbot-reset` resepectively.

if you are are the host, you can set the default probabilities in the `config.ts` file, but the server oweners
will be able to override this with the aforementioned command

## options
all options and configuration is done through `config.ts`.

you need to specify a bot token with the `token` key. the bot will not run without this.

you can configure how often pingbot will perform it's actions (a one in `x` chance of performing the action) with these
config keys:
 - `probabilities.ping` chance of pingbot pinging everyone (default: `10000`).
 - `probabilities.react` chance of pingbot reacting to messages (default: `100`).
 - `probabilities.nickname` chance of pingbot changeing someone's nickname (default: `1000`).
 - `probabilities.dm` chance of pingbot sending you an insulting dm (defaults: `1000`)
 - `probabilities.chad` chance of pingbot responding with the chad face (default: `1000`)

## setup
setup is simple:
 1. clone the bot.
 2. install the dependencies with `yarn` (or `npm install`). if either of these commands don't work, you need to install
 [node][2].
 3. create a bot user & invite it to your server (follow [this guide][1], but use the code in this repo as the bot's
 code).
 4. create a `config.ts` file and set `token` equal to the token obtained in the previous step (`export const token = '<token>'`).
 5. add your desired options to the `config.ts` file.
 6. run the bot with `yarn start` (or `npm run start`). alternatively you can run it with `node ./src/index.js`.
 7. enjoy!

 if you prefer docker:
 1. follow steps 1-5 of normal setup
 2. run the bot with docker compose up --build
 3. enjoy!

note: if you want the 'o o f' function to work in the voice channels, you need to install ffmpeg.

### personal recommendation
when creating the bot user, you are most likely going to want to choose an image for pingbot to use as a profile
picture. my personal favourite is shown below with two variations: pinged (the better choice) and boring. i
recommend these because they perfectly capture the essence of the bot, and the pinged variation was
the server icon of the server this bot was written for.
